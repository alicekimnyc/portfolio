         <section>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p><b>Inspo cloud is a designer and creators focused cloud storage product. Its aim is to provide users with the freedom to organize their work and ideas with an engaging experience than any other cloud storage product.</b><br><br>
               A group of designers that uses cloud storage daily expressed frustrations with their current platforms. Inspo Cloud is to introduce the tools to give them more control and user-friendly features focused on their needs.
            </p>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <h4>There’s no cloud storage in the market that fits Designers’ needs.</h4>
            <p>According to a user survey with participants of designers, there were expressed frustrations with the big-name cloud storage in the market. Design files are unable to preview unless downloaded from the cloud which adds another step and takes time. Also, users had difficulties finding files if they forgot the file name. This survey showed that there was an opportunity to improve viewing and organizing features catering to designers.</p>

            <p>Thumbnails for design files like Figma, Sketch, and Illustrator on Google Drive which makes it hard for users to quickly find a file.</p>

         <!--SOLUTION SUMMARY SECTION-->
           <section class="soultion" id="highlight">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <h4>Providing more visuals means quick access.</h4>
            <p>By allowing all design files to display a thumbnail preview, users can easily identify what they are looking for. Along with keyword search and thumbnail preview, users can open the file assuring that it’s the correct file.</p>

            <h4>Giving users tools to organize their work and Ideas.</h4>
            <p>Many designers are intuitive to digital artboards and physical boards. By expanding on that intuition, users can organize files, notes, and folders on multiple boards.</p>

            <p>Below are the 5-6 sketches that were created after mind-mapping. The first sketches of the palette could be polished to be an abstract cloud with multiple colors. The cloud is a bit overdone in the cloud storage market, but adding the abstract “i” makes it unique and a marketable logo. The board is a simple logo but thought it represents the product’s key feature. It could be improved with brand’s logo abbreviation. Going into a more fun direction, sketching diamonds, unicorns, and feathers. They represent unique, special, creative freedom, and reliance. </p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>With a narrowed audience to cloud storage for designers, I’ve learned how designers use cloud storage platforms and what they would like to see in a new cloud storage. There are many satisfied users of their current platforms, but also many frustrations that could be opportunities for Inspo Cloud.
               List of new ideas for Inspo Cloud had to be prioritized with our personas in mind. To avoid dumping all the features that our competitors don’t have, the design process of user stories was so helpful directing the project forward.
            </p>


            <h2>What I would've done differently</h2>
               Frustration in sharing methods and sharing access were another opportunity for this project. During the low-fidelity stage, I designed screens with a “sharing chat-box” where the user can view all the people that have access to the file along with file history of views, edits, and comments. The sharing chat-box was designed similar to iMessage screen so that users don’t have to use other forms of communication to discuss with members of the file.
               I would’ve liked to design further with this idea if given more time. But it was important for me to finish the project with the direction I found and stick with it. The overall branding and features blend well together for Inspo Cloud and the sharing tools could be added at a later stage which could attract more users to our platform.
