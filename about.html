          Hello! I'm Alice,<br>a Product Designer based in New York City.
        </h1>
        <h2 class="intro_text">
          My obsession with design started with the first video game I played on the computer as a young child.

  <p>I wanted to create my own characters and games so with the only tool I had at that time which is Microsoft paint, I started illustrating story boards and games.
    I created mini games by illustrating multiple pages and allowed my family members to participate as I switched the pages for them. Soon enough my father taught me to use other programs like CoralDraw, Illustrator and Photoshop.
    I continued to study arts & design and it wasn’t until I moved to New York I found my true passion. Working in the fashion industry, a fast-paced industry that was well behind on technology, we faced many frustrations with the PLM software systems we used. I was curious to identify the problems my colleagues and I faced to find solutions on how to make the software work better for us. My constant curiosity led me to find the world of UX and the start of my journey to a new field that felt right for me. As a designer, I'd like to provide products that bring people happiness and make their lives easier. My goal is to always design with empathy for the users and to explore out of my comfort zone to do so.
